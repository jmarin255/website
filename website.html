        <h2>My personal interests</h2>
        <p class="paragraph">I really like videogames, my first ever console was a gift from my uncle, it was a psp back when I was 9 or 10 years old,
        and also because of him is why like videogames,I would just see him play way before and that's what got me hooked too, 
        I like all kinds of videogames really but if i had to choose my favorites I would say sports games like FIFA or Madden, 
        as far as shooting games I like Call of Duty, Apex as well.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> I like coding (of course), ever since I was a kid I've always been obssesed about computers in general, back then
        I remember that everything I did as far as coding was only to cheat on some pc game I was playing at the time, since
        it was a facebook game it was kind of hard to do but I actually got it to work once ;). Right now I got some basics 
        concepts with Python and a little of C++, the reason why I choose CS was because of either cybersecurity or web development.</p>

        <p class="paragraph"> also like cars, I'm not a mechanic whatsoever but this interested of mine started not too long ago and I'm not
        sure why, currently I have a 2018 Dodge Charger (The one in my picture). I really like it, I got it around a year ago
        right before I turned 21, it is my first car as well, I do plan to sell it in the future though, my dream car that hopefully
        someday I  will have is a Nissan GTR.</p>
